# Miniscope-v4-MCU
# This project is for the small MCU PCB of the Miniscope V4. 

The original PCB was designed along side the CMOS PCB and SER-Power PCB in CircuitStudio but I wanted to make some modifications to the MCU PCB as well as start porting all projects over to KiCad. The main changes from the original MCU PCB are the following:
* Added a 50mil 2x3 ISP interface for programming the Atmega328 without the need to solder wires.
* Changed the output of the board to interface with the dual digital potentiometer used on the LED + ETL Driver PCB.

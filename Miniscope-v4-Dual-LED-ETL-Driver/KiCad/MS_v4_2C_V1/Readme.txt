This folder contains the files used for fabrication for the first iteration of the dual color Miniscope as shown at SFN2019. 

Although the miniscope worked it had two errors:

1) The LEDs are not aligned with the center of the excitation module

2) The width of the PCB does not match the width of the excitation module

3) It's very hard to align everything with glue

Proposed solutions for the second iteration:

1) Move the LEDs so they can align with the center of the excitation module. This will be useful too to check if the 3mm half ball lens is enough

2) Match the width of the PCB with the width of the excitation module

3) Add two screws to the side for easier aligment and fixation
